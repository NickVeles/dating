A long-distance relationship (LDR) is basically a romantic partnership where the two people are **geographically separated**, often by many miles or time zones. In practical terms it means you can't just pop over for dinner or a movie &ndash; you have to rely on phones and video chat. Despite the distance, LDRs are quite common (among college students they make up about 25-50% of relationships<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_relationship#:~:text=A%20long,particularly%20prevalent%20among%20college%20students)</sup>). Research even finds that LDRs can work just as often as regular ones (roughly a 60% “success” rate) if both people are committed<sup>[[2]](https://www.vogue.com/article/long-distance-relationships#:~:text=The%20success%20rate%20of%20long,relationships)</sup>. In other words, it can work, but it takes extra effort.

## Who Should Be in an LDR (and Who Shouldn't)

LDRs are almost never something you “look for” on purpose. They usually happen out of necessity &ndash; for example, work, school, military service, or family reasons<sup>[[3]](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/articles/how-to-make-a-long-distance-relationship-work/#:~:text=I%20often%20get%20asked%20about,distance%20can%20be)</sup>. Most advice is: if you can date someone nearby instead, do it! Young adults (late teens and 20s) often end up in LDRs when they move for college or jobs, because they have some freedom and resources. In contrast, high-school-age teens usually **can't** easily overcome the distance: they often don't have their own money or independence to travel, and parents won't let them just pack up and move. In fact, one guide warns that teens rarely have the *transportation* or funds for regular visits<sup>[[4]](https://mappingmegan.com/young-love-and-long-distance-relationships/#:~:text=Long%20distance%20relationships%20can%20be,laid%20out%20by%20your%20parents)</sup>.

Even for adults, an LDR isn't for everyone. Before you commit, ask yourself if this person is really worth it. Experts stress that LDRs **require real sacrifice, patience, and commitment**. As dating coach Sabrina Bendory advises: “Long-distance relationships require...commitment &ndash; so before diving in, ask yourself: is this person truly worth it?…If you're holding [onto a relationship] out of habit, fear, or the idea of love rather than real love, it's time to reassess<sup>[[5]](https://www.vogue.com/article/long-distance-relationships#:~:text=1)</sup>.” In short, LDRs are generally suitable for adults who have some life flexibility. Teens or anyone who isn't ready to move or work abroad will likely find it nearly impossible to eventually be together

## How to Plan Your LDR

Good planning is **critical**. Both partners should agree on a clear, shared plan for the months ahead. Key steps include:
- **Make a communication plan**. Decide how often you'll text, call, or video-chat (daily check-ins are ideal). Dr. Rachel Vanderbilt recommends setting up a communication schedule and even virtual dates &ndash; for example, a nightly video call or weekly “movie night” &ndash; so you always have something to look forward to<sup>[[6]](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/articles/how-to-make-a-long-distance-relationship-work/#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20be,something%20to%20look%20forward%20to)</sup>.
- **Set concrete goals**. Talk about when you'll next meet and your longer-term timeline. Pick specific milestones (e.g. “I'll visit in April” or “We'll move in together next year”). Mark Manson points out that LDRs need milestones: “if they're not growing, then they're dying,” and couples need “some goal that unites you” or else you'll “drift apart”<sup>[[7]](https://markmanson.net/long-distance-relationships#:~:text=The%20minute%20you%20stop%20having,you%20will%20inevitably%20drift%20apart)</sup>. So always plan the next reunion or shared project.
- **Share future planning**. Discuss where and when you might eventually live together. It could be in one partner's city or a new location. Ask yourselves: *“When could we realistically live together? What do we need first &ndash; jobs, finishing school, visas?”*<sup>[[8]](https://psyche.co/guides/research-backed-tips-for-making-a-long-distance-relationship-work)</sup>. Being open about pros/cons of each location helps you unite behind one plan.
- **Divide the work**. Each partner should take responsibility for a task. For example: who will save money or earn more so you can afford a move? Who will look for jobs or apartments in the other's city? As one advice guide notes, knowing **what each of you is doing** (saving up, searching for a job, etc.) “gives you a sense of progress and purpose in your separate lives”.
- **Set a deadline**. An LDR can't drag on forever. Agree on a rough timeline to evaluate the relationship (for example, “Six months from now we either live in the same country or we break up”). (Mark Manson's own advice: he and his wife “immediately made plans to end the distance as soon as possible (six months)”, and then sacrificed what was needed to do so<sup>[[9]](https://markmanson.net/long-distance-relationships#:~:text=The%20third%20time%2C%20and%20perhaps,And%20now%20we%E2%80%99re%20married)</sup>) Having a target helps both people stay motivated and honest about whether this is working.
- **Be honest and supportive**. Regularly share your feelings and doubts. Distance can magnify insecurity, so promise to bring up problems early. For instance, Manson reminds us that when apart people can **'get insanely jealous or irrationally possessive'**<sup>[[10]](https://markmanson.net/long-distance-relationships#:~:text=This%20can%20manifest%20itself%20in,out%20with%20Dan%2C%20got%20it%3F%E2%80%9D)</sup>, even over innocent things. **Don't** let misunderstandings fester. As he advises, the best remedy is simply: “talk to your partner about what they're feeling and about what you're feeling”.

## How to Close the Distance

At some point you need a **plan to actually move closer**. This part is highly personal, but here are common strategies:
- **Plan your first visits**: Early on, both of you should take short trips to meet face-to-face (even if it's a shared vacation somewhere). In my very own case, we were saving up for a holiday to see if we really clicked in person. Short visits let you test the relationship on neutral ground.
- **Explore visas and work options**: Look into any special programs for young people or professionals. For me, Poland had (and still has) a working-holiday visa agreement with Australia (for ages 18-30) that lets you live and work there for up to a year<sup>[[11]](https://www.gov.pl/web/family/the-working-holiday-programme)</sup>. If you qualify, this could be a practical way for one person to move. Otherwise, check student visas, skilled-worker permits, or remote job possibilities in your partner's country.
- **Save and budget**: Closing the gap costs money (flights, moving expenses, etc.). Each person should start saving specifically for travel/relocation. Maybe cut back on non-essentials to fund at least a couple of visits (One tip from the LDR guide: save for a period of unemployment &ndash; e.g. if one of you leaves a job to move &ndash; so you're financially prepared).
- **Decide who moves**: Consider which partner has more flexibility. For example, if one is still in school and the other is established in a job, it might make sense for the working partner to relocate. In my situation, she was in college and I had a job, so it fell on me to plan moving abroad. Discuss this early so neither of you is caught off-guard.
- **Set a deadline and stick to it**: As mentioned, pick a time by which you *will* live together, and hold yourselves to it. If months go by with no meeting in sight, you risk growing apart. Manson puts it bluntly: without a shared goal the relationship “will inevitably drift apart”<sup>[[12]](https://markmanson.net/long-distance-relationships#:~:text=The%20minute%20you%20stop%20having,you%20will%20inevitably%20drift%20apart)</sup>. We gave ourselves about one year to make things work. If that time had passed with no progress, we agreed we would reevaluate honestly.

Be realistic, though. Sometimes life throws curveballs: jobs fall through, visa paperwork drags on, or emergencies happen. (In our case, sadly, my partner had an accident and realized she couldn't handle an LDR mentally, so we had to end things.) The point is to have a **plan** and a timeline, but also to agree now that you'll be honest if it's not possible. In many guides, couples say it honestly: if one of these steps fails (no job found, visa denied, no money saved), the long-distance often cannot continue.

## Fun Online Activities to Stay Connected

While apart, it's important to **do things together online** so you keep feeling like a couple. Here are some ideas:
- **Set up “virtual dates.”** For example, schedule a movie night where you stream the same film together (services like Netflix Party/Teleparty make this easy) or a video-dinner date where you both cook and eat the same recipe while on FaceTime. As relationship experts note, having planned “virtual date” activities (movies, dinners, etc.) gives you something to look forward to<sup>[[13]](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/articles/how-to-make-a-long-distance-relationship-work/#:~:text=2,setting%20virtual%20dates%20is%20crucial)</sup>.
- **Play games or quizzes**. Organize an online game night &ndash; there are tons of free multiplayer games on sites like Steam or web-based platforms. You can also do silly quizzes together (even BuzzFeed or personality quizzes) and compare results, which sparks great conversation. One LDR advice column specifically suggests an “Online Game Night” for some competitive fun<sup>[[14]](https://extension.usu.edu/hru/blog/26-date-ideas-for-a-long-distance-relationship#:~:text=An%20online%20game%20night%20might,competitive%20and%20exciting%20date%20night)</sup>.
- **Share everyday moments**. Even mundane activities feel special together from afar. Take a walk around your neighborhoods together on video chat (one partner shows around while on call)<sup>[[15]](https://extension.usu.edu/hru/blog/26-date-ideas-for-a-long-distance-relationship#:~:text=Go%20On%20A%20Walk%20Together)</sup>. Or have a “coffee date” on video each morning. Little routines like this (texting each other throughout the day or doing errands while chatting) help bridge the gap. Vanderbilt's research emphasizes that “consistent check-ins or setting virtual dates is crucial” for maintaining LDRs
<sup>[[16]](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/articles/how-to-make-a-long-distance-relationship-work/#:~:text=2,setting%20virtual%20dates%20is%20crucial)</sup>.
- **Get creative with connections**. Read the same book or watch the same TV series and discuss it. Start a shared playlist or Pinterest board of future plans. Try a virtual museum tour or online class together. Utah State's relationship blog even suggests things like a “virtual museum tour” or a shared “book club for two” to spark new conversation. The idea is to find any activity that you both enjoy and do it simultaneously.
- **Include friends/family sometimes**. If both partners are comfortable, plan a group video call with mutual friends or family. Nomad Business even recommends virtual double-dates or group hangouts to make your SO feel integrated into your life<sup>[[17]](https://nomadbusiness.com/blogs/countrynomad-1/online-activities-for-long-distance-couples#:~:text=Bring%20Families%20and%20Friends)</sup>. This can remind you that you're each part of each other's social world, even at a distance.

Each couple is different, so mix and match what sounds fun. The key is regular shared experiences. If you make time for these virtual “dates,” you'll keep the spark alive &ndash; after all, LDRs thrive on imagination and effort as much as on proximity.

**In Summary**: Long-distance romance can work if both people put in the work. Define your relationship clearly, plan concrete steps together, and keep communicating and connecting in creative ways. Trust and commitment are non-negotiable. If you both really value the relationship, you'll find ways to share your lives &ndash; from scheduling video call dates to planning trips and a shared future. But if not, it's okay to acknowledge that too. As one expert says, distance only *exposes* what was already there in the relationship<sup>[[18]](https://www.vogue.com/article/long-distance-relationships#:~:text=This%20is%20because%20the%20qualities,%E2%80%9CIf%20a%20relationship)</sup>. With honest talk and lots of mutual effort, many couples do make LDRs work, even when oceans lie between them.
