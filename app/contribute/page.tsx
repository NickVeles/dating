          Even though it's an open source project, it's also part of my
          portfolio, and I am very strict on any code changes, since this
          project is meant to reflect my skills.

        <P>
          However, you're always welcome to contribute any typo fixes and post
          edits. Remember to uphold the common GitHub etiquette, as well as
          appending yourself to the list of editors at the top of the post file
          (<Code className="bg-background">editorsIds</Code> property &ndash;
          you can use the Id value of <Code className="bg-background">0</Code>{" "}
          to stay anonymous), as well as the list of writers (in{" "}
          <Code className="bg-background">constants/writers.ts</Code>) if you're
          not already there.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you want to make any major code changes, I'd appreciate if you
          provided me with your reasoning at the very least! I'm still a junior
          programmer, and I want to learn as much as possible! Any guidance,
          even verbal, is more than you could imagine!
